## üìå Overview

Agriculture and food production are major contributors to **global CO‚ÇÇ emissions** üåç.
This project applies **regression models** to predict and analyze CO‚ÇÇ emissions from different agri-food activities.

The goal is to:

* Understand the relationship between **agricultural factors** and **CO‚ÇÇ output**
* Build machine learning regression models to estimate emissions
* Provide insights for **sustainable agriculture & food systems**
